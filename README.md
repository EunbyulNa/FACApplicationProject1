# FAC-Application-Project [Hobby page]

## ðŸ’¡ Idea
This webpage is dedicated to one of my favorite Netflix shows, "Queen's Gambit." <br>
I am a huge fan of the main character, Beth Harmon. <br>
The goal of the page is to showcase who is in the show and what the story is about, using a simple and modern layout. <br>
I've included interesting features such as a hamburger menu, responsive layout, and icons linking to my LinkedIn, Github, and Medium profiles.

## ðŸš€ Feature 
The webpage has three pages, each with a navigation bar and footer that are designed to be responsive.<br>
When the window size reaches 800px, the navigation bar changes to a hamburger menu and all contents are displayed in a single column.

##### âœ… Home
The home section features a main menu at the top, next to which there is a today's date generated by a JavaScript date function. <br>
In the CAST section, you can see three main characters of the show in a flexbox. <br>
By clicking on each character's name or image, you will be directed to a Wikipedia page to see more information. <br>
The contents are designed to perfectly fit without being cut off or overflowing, even when the window is resized.

##### âœ… About 
The about story section has a main head, image, and paragraph with a simple and modern layout that fits any window screen size.

##### âœ… Episode 
The episode section is designed to show each episode's story using flexbox. <br>
In mobile size, the contents are displayed in a single column.
